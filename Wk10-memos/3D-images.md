# 3D-images

- I think 3D imaging is an important tool is digital archaeology. It allows a non-destructive way of documenting and preserving an artifact. This gives researchers the ability to return to the object and analyze and study the object/structure more later.
- I think it also brings an element of accessibility (depending on its availability online) but it allows many archaeologist to access and study it. This allows more individuals interpretations, ideas and thoughts to give new insights and stories assocaiated with the object.
- It also allows these elements to potentially be used in digital platforms for story telling...I'm not sure if that is how it works but this week we read this paper by [Vrettakis, Ektor et al. 2019](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/1-s2.0-S2212054819300074-main.pdf) called Narralive – Creating and experiencing mobile digital storytelling in cultural heritage and it talks about a online digital storytelling platform they created and I am not one to understand how to design it but I am sure 3D imaging or other online saved digital objects/places help to design and create a online story that individuals can explore and walk through digitally enhancing there understanding.

# Week Ten

## New Terms
When I think of storytelling I think of a made up fictional story. This week however, looking at the story in context with archaeology is figuring out what happened in the past the story of what occured. This weeks perspective on story telling changed the term storytelling for me to think more broadly outside of a fictional story (since that is what I like to read) and remind myself there are non fictional stories and stories of the past that do have truth to them to give meaning, understanding and context to an individual about the specific topic/group/place ect in the archaeological field. 

## Commands
One command that stuck out to me this week was 
for i in range 
I made sure I understood the meaning behind it, in regards to a loop feature that would go through each image trying to be located to download it for us to complete our activity. It was neat playing around with some of the code this week and continuing my understanding on the function behind the weird language

## Error 
Before it was posted on discord how to import images for the [photogrammetry-intro.ipynb](photogrammetry-intro-Copy1.ipynb) activity to use your own images I 
definetly got a lot of errors trying to load the images errors saying it could not find the file or directory. At one point I got the code to download the files I had uploaded to github however, something did not download correctly still the filename was there but the green box image icon was present instead of the image. So I took a break, I came back and I realized if the filenames had downloaded into the directory I made I just physically replaced those files with files with the exact same name but that contained the image and it allowed me to continue on with the activity. I did go back and walk through the video of downloading them locally once that was available but it was nice I found a way around the issue to explore the activity further using my own data. 

## Websites
The [video](https://kommodo.ai/recordings/naW8jp6RXSlRVrWheVvm) given explaining how to download our images was very helpful. Also I used the website called [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com/feed) that helped me obtain a 3D image of the castle and my gravestone thought they look very very strange it was fun going thorugh the process to try and create the 3D image.

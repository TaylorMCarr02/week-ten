# Week Ten Journal

Two quotes I really like from [this paper by Gareth Beale , Lizzie Robertson , Nicole Smith](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca/2025/03/17/what-next-for-archaeological-representation/) are
"Archaeology is so infused with the digital that to listen to archaeology and to consider the significance of what you are hearing, can open up entirely new ways of 
thinking about the past and, consequently, entirely new research agendas." and "archaeology must learn from cultures of creative practice if we are to fully understand 
and realise the potential impacts of our discipline across the broader political, cultural, economic landscape in which we work."

- The first quote I feel bridges digital archaeology with creative thinking. What we listen to and the stories we hear can bring new ideas about the past and what happened. This
in turn like the quote says can bring new research pathways leading to even more discovery about the past.
- Not only that but linking this to the second quote and topics we have touched on in this course hearing stories and creative practices from people or groups who use that kind of
approach allows us to implement this practice/stories into our digital work and that can be used to educate people about the past and broaden peoples ideas to think creatively.
- Thinking about this from a personal experience, I was blessed to spend some time in Northern BC working with local indigenous communities. The way they share their heritage and
culture through stories and creative practices such as art, dancing and songs that can be passed down through generations. Working alongside these communities and groups and
using their voices to connect people to understand their past and culture helps educate individuals which is such a powerful tool.
This can also help bridge what impacts digital work can have on these stories making sure they are not lost nor misinterpreted. This does bring a set of ethical implications
making sure stories and cultural practices used with online tools for educating is respected and properly used.

- I feel when it comes to a creative mindset in archaeology it makes you really challenge yourself and broaden your perspective on things and as a shcolar this can allow you to
really push yourself in understanding and new thinking of research. In public history this can really push in areas such as accessibility making sure all voices are heard to get
many different stories out there broadening our ideas on the past. Also pushes you in who you collaborate with to get stories and ideas not typically heard out there. Finally
it pushes you on the digital side of things being creative and working with others to create ways online to truly get an understanding of the past through stories to educate people.

- this week I focused on the photogrammy activity creating a digital 3D image and though that did not focus specifically on stories. It does bring the element of a creative
mindset, you have to use your imagination to visualize the 3D image and understand its meaning and this can bring new ideas and broaden your ideas on the past. It also brought
an element of understanding the impact and work it takes for individuals to make online tools to tell a sotry. The 3D images used and chosen to tell a story of the past is so
important and taking time to understand their importance in the story and why you are using them can be beneficial for not only your understanding but also how the people who
will be visualizing the 3D images what ideas they may take away from them and aid in their understanding of the past.

- One thing I was really proud of this week was I was finally able to try and accomplish an activity without instructions, I used the templated code and got my own images to
make a (poorly looking) [3D image]() but nevertheless I got it to work! I feel this shows I am starting to understand the code a bit more and how it works and have pushed myself to
try different approcahes to make it work. I got stuck and had to walk away many times but in the end with help on discord, google and just really going through the original code
and learning what parts to change to make it work I got there in the end! 

- Not only that but I felt super proud of myself to play around with the website making activity and make a decent looking website about my [graveyard experience](Graveyard-Website.png)

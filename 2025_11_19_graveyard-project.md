# Graveyard Work

Here is the graveyard map that I made at
[Kemptville Public Cemetary](my-map.geojson)


+ While in the field I learned that not all grave stones are remotely simple at fiting into a category using [this websites](http://debs.ac.uk/files/CodeSheets.pdf) guidelines, there are many limitations to putting data into a box.

from the beginning of the project can be found here and compared to the map I made above
+ When I went to the graveyard I had a moment when I realized two things:
One -> the gathering of data (with regards to the names on graves and dates) could be very beneficial to people who want to find information on family members from the past.
Two -> the people who have since past away and who's graves I am examing may not have been okay with me doing what I am currently doing which felt really off to me
+ For me I had a really hard time walking around the graveyard thinking in my mind that I am walking over people who are at dead in the ground. There was one section in the graveyard where I was recording data that was clearly a family tombstone (large tall stone with all four sides containing family names) and around this stone was a stone edge outlining a box of grass around the tombstone. The area was clearly a large enough size to fit all these family members under the grassy area that this stone ridge outlined and I refused to walk on the grass that was within this outline it just felt off or wrong maybe because I could see the specific area of the grave unlike the other tombstones which just had gras around them but no outline to show where the bodies were. Definetly was a weird experience.
+ We used [this website](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/uIGvnNmd) to record our data.
